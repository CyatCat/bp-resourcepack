## A Minecraft Resource Pack for Block Party
Having trouble playing block party?  Getting a lot of F's in the chat?  Does gray look like brown and vice versa?

bp-resourcepack replaces the dull clay textures with brighter and more discernible colors.

## What does it do?
This is very light weight resource pack.  All it does is replace the standard 16 hardened clay block textures with color enhanced versions.  That's it.
